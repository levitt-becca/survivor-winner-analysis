"""
SURVIVOR WINNERS ANALYSIS

This analysis examines data from the reality TV show Survivor to identify patterns
and characteristics that distinguish winners from other contestants. Using gameplay
statistics, demographic data, and strategic metrics, we aim to uncover what makes
the "ultimate" Survivor winner.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
- What gameplay strategies are most effective for winning?
- How do winner characteristics vary across different eras of the show?
- What demographic factors correlate with success?
- Is there a definitive "winning formula" or is success highly variable?

METHODOLOGY:
The analysis uses contestant data including voting records, challenge performance,
advantage usage, and demographic information. Players are categorized by play style
(Physical, Strategic, Social, Advantage-Heavy) and game statistics are normalized
per tribal council to account for varying game lengths.

KEY METRICS:
- Votes Received per Tribal: Measures how much of a target a player was
- Correct Vote Rate: Strategic awareness and information gathering
- Individual Immunity Rate: Physical capability and clutch performance
- Advantage Usage: Modern game adaptation and resource management
- Tribal Attendance: Game longevity and deep run capability

The analysis reveals both consistent patterns among winners and significant variance
that demonstrates Survivor's unpredictable nature.

DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE:
The typical Survivor winner is in their {top_age.lower()}, most commonly working in 
{top_job.lower()}. 

GAMEPLAY STRATEGY:
Winners excel at the "{best_style.lower()}" play style, which has a {best_style_rate:.1%} 
success rate. The data shows that winners typically:
‚Ä¢ Stay Under the Radar: Receive only {win_stats.loc['mean', 'votesreceived_pertribal']:.2f} votes per tribal council
‚Ä¢ Vote Strategically: Have a {win_stats.loc['mean', 'correctvote_rate']:.1%} correct voting rate  
‚Ä¢ Show Physical Strength: Win {win_stats.loc['mean', 'immunities_pertribal']:.1%} of individual immunities
‚Ä¢ Play Actively: Cast {win_stats.loc['mean', 'votescast_pertribal']:.2f} votes per tribal council
‚Ä¢ Use Advantages Sparingly: Play {win_stats.loc['mean', 'advantagesplayed_pertribal']:.3f} advantages per tribal

ELITE WINNER CHARACTERISTICS:
The most dominant winners (elite tier) separate themselves by:
- Voting correctly over 80% of the time
- Receiving less than 1 vote per tribal council  
- Winning individual immunities at a 20%+ rate
